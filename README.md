# Airlines Images

A repository containing images for airlines -- specifically -- banners and logos.

This repository was generated by running [Jack Sweeney](https://github.com/Jxck-S)'s [airline-logo-scraper](https://github.com/Jxck-S/airline-logo-scraper). If you haven't heard of Jack, you're missing out. Go follow him (and follow me, [Kevin Elliott](https://github.com/kevinelliott) and [Airframes](https://github.com/airframesio) too while you're at it).

We make these images available for the common good.
